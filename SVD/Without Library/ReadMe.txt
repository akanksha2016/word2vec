This(q2b) is for SVD implementation from scratch.

The folder contains three folders:
1. input
2. src
3. output

The input folder contains the input file "text8" to read the corpus from.

The src folder conatins the svd_scratch.py file. It consist of the code for implementing SVD from scratch.

The output folder consists of:
	> dictionary (as dictionary of vocabulary) 
	> vector_matrix (as matrix of vector represntation of words in vocabulary with reduced dimension)
	> vector_rep.txt to show the vector representation of words in the vocabulary indexed by the words
	> Plot of 100 most frequent words as SVDwithoutlib.png.
