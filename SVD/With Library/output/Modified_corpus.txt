published in a now UNK UNK the UNK child almost every UNK he UNK described is still UNK as UNK of the autistic spectrum of disorders at the same time an austrian UNK dr UNK asperger described a

almost five zero years the UNK of his work UNK t UNK UNK until one nine nine seven thus these two UNK were described and are today UNK in the UNK and UNK UNK of mental disorders UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK one as two of the five pervasive developmental disorders UNK more often referred to today as autism spectrum disorders UNK all of these UNK are UNK by UNK UNK of UNK in communication UNK

UNK means or a UNK UNK to more UNK UNK a diagnosis UNK when UNK to UNK UNK with autism the term autistic is often used however the term person with autism can be used UNK this is referred to as person first UNK the autistic community generally UNK the term autistic for UNK that are UNK controversial this article uses the term autistic see UNK UNK UNK dr UNK UNK UNK the UNK early UNK autism in one nine four three there is a great UNK in the UNK and UNK of individuals UNK as autistic and UNK will often UNK at different UNK about the UNK diagnosis much of this is due to the UNK system of an autistic which is UNK different from the UNK system of other people since certain UNK can UNK an autistic UNK than a non autistic and the UNK to which the UNK system is UNK UNK UNK from one autistic person to another nevertheless UNK within UNK UNK and development often UNK for early UNK of autism in order to UNK UNK as early as possible however some people do not believe in UNK for autism either because they do not believe autism is a disorder or because they believe UNK can do more UNK than good social development UNK UNK UNK are social UNK early in life they do such things as UNK at people UNK UNK UNK UNK a UNK and even UNK in contrast most autistic children UNK objects to UNK and UNK to have UNK UNK UNK to UNK in the give and take of UNK human interaction even in the first few months

may UNK UNK such things as UNK and UNK without UNK or UNK UNK UNK later they UNK seek UNK from others or UNK to UNK UNK of UNK or UNK in a UNK way research has UNK that although autistic children are UNK to their UNK their UNK of this UNK is UNK and UNK to UNK UNK who UNK UNK to the UNK of UNK UNK and UNK with their child may UNK UNK by this lack of expected UNK behavior children with autism appear to lack theory of mind the ability to see things from another person s UNK a behavior UNK as UNK to human UNK above the age of five and UNK other higher UNK such as UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK five year UNK can develop UNK into other people s different knowledge UNK and UNK UNK based upon social UNK e g UNK UNK UNK an individual with autism UNK to lack these UNK UNK an UNK that UNK them UNK to UNK or understand other people s actions the social UNK of autistic and asperger s people is so UNK from childhood that many of them have UNK friends as UNK however having an UNK UNK is not UNK a UNK of autism and also UNK in non autistic children although not universal it is common for autistic people to not UNK their behavior this can take the form of UNK or UNK UNK that may UNK out of UNK to the UNK individuals with autism generally UNK UNK UNK and UNK they may UNK UNK to changes in them it is not UNK for these individuals to UNK UNK increased UNK of self UNK behavior self UNK or UNK UNK in UNK UNK UNK system a UNK UNK to UNK making a UNK UNK for autism would include UNK for UNK much like those found in UNK UNK UNK children will UNK problems UNK with the normal UNK UNK UNK of this

UNK UNK new movements UNK in making UNK from one UNK to another social and or UNK problems UNK in speech language or motor UNK specific UNK UNK UNK in academic UNK one common example is an individual

people see UNK party effect however this is UNK the part of the autism that UNK to UNK the most from person to person so these UNK may not UNK to every autistic it should be UNK that UNK UNK although UNK common in autistics are not part of the UNK UNK UNK UNK for autistic disorder communication UNK by age three UNK children have UNK UNK language UNK UNK one of the UNK is UNK by the first UNK a UNK UNK says words UNK when he or she UNK his or her name UNK when he or she UNK a UNK and when UNK something UNK makes it UNK that the UNK is no speech development in people with autism UNK different UNK some UNK UNK throughout their lives while being UNK UNK and able to UNK in other ways UNK UNK language and UNK are far more natural to them some UNK who later show UNK of autism UNK and UNK during the

UNK UNK for UNK and can often be found in online UNK UNK UNK UNK or UNK and even using communication UNK at autism community social UNK such as UNK those who do speak often use language in UNK ways UNK features of earlier UNK of language development for long UNK or throughout their lives some speak only single words while others UNK the same UNK over and over some UNK what they UNK a UNK called UNK UNK song UNK in particular are a UNK UNK UNK that many autistic UNK UNK in many people with autism have a strong UNK sense and can often understand UNK language some children may UNK only UNK UNK in language or even UNK to have UNK language and UNK large UNK but have great UNK in UNK UNK UNK the give and take of non autistic UNK is UNK for them although they often UNK on a UNK on a UNK subject UNK no one UNK an UNK to UNK when given the chance to UNK with other autistics they UNK do so in UNK UNK taking UNK UNK views and information just as UNK people without autism have UNK understanding autistic body languages UNK UNK or UNK people with autism UNK have UNK with such things in people without autism in particular autistic language UNK tend to be highly UNK people without autism often UNK UNK UNK meaning to what people with autism say or UNK the person with autism to sense such UNK meaning in their own words the body language of people with autism can be UNK for other people to understand UNK UNK movements and UNK may be UNK UNK by some other people with autism but do not UNK those used by other people also their UNK of UNK has a much more UNK UNK in UNK their UNK and the UNK system of a person without autism often cannot sense the UNK what UNK to non autistic people like a high UNK UNK song or UNK UNK like UNK is common in autistic children some autistic children with relatively good language UNK speak like little UNK rather than UNK at their current age level which is one of the things that can lead to problems since non autistic people are often UNK with the autistic body language and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech autistic people often UNK to UNK other people know what they need as UNK might do in such a UNK they may UNK in UNK or UNK to UNK what they UNK while UNK for non autistic people to learn to UNK with them people with autism do UNK they can to get through to them communication UNK may UNK to autistic people UNK UNK UNK or UNK UNK UNK although people with autism usually appear UNK normal and have good UNK control UNK UNK UNK known as self UNK or UNK may set them UNK these UNK might be UNK and highly UNK or more UNK some children and UNK individuals UNK a UNK of time UNK UNK their UNK or UNK their UNK others UNK UNK in position as children they might UNK UNK UNK up their UNK and UNK in a certain way not using them for UNK play if UNK UNK UNK one of these UNK the child may be UNK UNK autistic children often need and UNK UNK UNK in their environment a UNK change in any UNK in UNK UNK taking a UNK or going to school at a certain time and by the same UNK can be UNK UNK people with autism sometimes have a UNK UNK UNK for example the child might be UNK with UNK all about UNK UNK UNK UNK or UNK often they show great interest in different languages UNK UNK or science topics UNK UNK can also UNK into the UNK word as well UNK of a single word or UNK even for a specific number of times can also become a part of the child s UNK UNK effects in education children with autism are UNK with these UNK every day these UNK UNK set them UNK from the UNK normal UNK because they have UNK understanding people s UNK and UNK they have UNK understanding what their UNK may be UNK them they do not understand that UNK UNK and UNK UNK UNK UNK and may UNK what UNK their UNK is UNK this UNK to UNK UNK the world around them makes education UNK UNK need to be UNK of a UNK s disorder so that they are able to help the UNK get the best out of the UNK being UNK some students learn better with UNK UNK as they are better able to understand material UNK this way because of this many UNK UNK UNK UNK for their autistic students this UNK the UNK to know what is going on throughout the day so they know what to UNK for and what UNK they will be doing next some autistic children have UNK going from one UNK to the next so this UNK UNK can help to UNK UNK research has UNK that working in UNK may be UNK to autistic children autistic students have problems in schools not only with language and communication but with UNK as well they UNK self UNK about themselves and many UNK that they will always be UNK by UNK them to work with UNK they can make friends which in UNK can help them UNK with the problems that UNK by doing so they can become more UNK into the UNK environment of the UNK a UNK s UNK can also be UNK to the UNK the UNK is able to give more UNK UNK that the UNK may not have time to UNK to the autistic child the UNK can also UNK the autistic child in such a way as to UNK them to UNK at a similar level to the UNK of the class this UNK a UNK one on one UNK UNK so that the child is still able to UNK in a normal UNK but be given the UNK help that they need there are many different techniques that UNK can use to UNK their students a UNK UNK to become UNK with the child s disorder to know what will work best with that particular child every child is going to be different and UNK have to be able to UNK with every one of them students with autism spectrum disorders UNK have high UNK of UNK and UNK particularly in social UNK like school if a UNK UNK UNK or UNK behavior it is important for UNK UNK to UNK the UNK of UNK and UNK UNK students for new UNK by writing social UNK can lower UNK UNK social and UNK concepts using UNK UNK UNK such as the UNK five point UNK or other UNK UNK UNK can

some UNK UNK to UNK autistics who can speak or UNK as being autistic at all because they still UNK of autism as a communication disorder so UNK that no speech or writing is possible as a UNK many high

that at least part of the UNK for the UNK rise is UNK better UNK asperger s and UNK s syndrome asperger described his UNK as little UNK in the current UNK and UNK UNK of mental disorders UNK UNK UNK the most significant UNK between autistic disorder UNK s and asperger s syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former includes the UNK of UNK or UNK functioning in at least one of the following areas with UNK prior to age three years one social interaction two language as used in social communication or three UNK or UNK play while a diagnosis of asperger s syndrome UNK no UNK significant UNK in these areas the UNK makes no UNK of level of intellectual functioning but the fact that asperger s autistics as a group tend to UNK better than those with UNK s autism has produced a popular UNK that asperger s syndrome is UNK with higher functioning autism or that it is a UNK disorder than autism there is also a popular but not UNK true UNK that all autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning have asperger s autism or that both UNK are UNK UNK with a UNK UNK UNK also autism has UNK in the public understanding but the popular UNK of autism with relatively UNK UNK as UNK UNK in UNK man has UNK UNK of family members UNK in the autistic spectrum to speak of their UNK UNK as having asperger s syndrome rather than autism autism as a spectrum disorder another view of these disorders is that they are on a UNK known as autistic spectrum disorders a related UNK is UNK UNK UNK which is about how well we UNK the information we receive from our UNK autism asperger s syndrome and UNK UNK UNK are all closely related and UNK there are two main UNK of classical autism UNK autism and early UNK autism early UNK autism is present at UNK while UNK autism UNK before the age of three and often around one eight months although this causes some UNK over when the UNK UNK involved in autism UNK UNK some believe that it is only a matter of when an UNK UNK UNK the disorder this UNK could UNK during UNK due to a UNK that UNK the mother s body and is UNK to the UNK the UNK could also UNK after UNK during the UNK early UNK system development of the child due to a UNK UNK UNK the child s body increase in UNK of autism the number of UNK UNK of autism has increased UNK over the past UNK statistics in UNK from the national center for health statistics there has been an UNK UNK in UNK UNK of autism over the last UNK years which is largely UNK of UNK in the diagnosis of UNK and UNK UNK disorder in the UNK century this has brought rise to a number of different theories as to the nature of the UNK increase UNK argue that the rise in UNK in the united states is UNK or UNK UNK to changes in UNK UNK UNK public awareness and the UNK to receive UNK UNK services a UNK UNK study from the m i UNK d institute in UNK one seven UNK two zero zero two claimed that the increase in autism is real even after those UNK UNK are UNK for see reference in this section below other UNK UNK UNK see references below including dr UNK UNK a UNK of UNK at the university of UNK health sciences center at san UNK and UNK of the american academy of UNK autism UNK UNK who says there is a chance we re UNK a true rise but right now i UNK t UNK UNK can UNK that question for UNK UNK reference below the UNK to this question has significant UNK on the UNK of research since a real increase would focus more UNK and research UNK on the search for UNK UNK while little or no real increase would focus more UNK to UNK on the other UNK it is UNK that certain UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK changes may have a particular UNK on people with a specific UNK constitution there is little public research on the effects of in UNK UNK on the number of UNK of autism one of the more popular theories is that there is a UNK between UNK and autism this is UNK for UNK by a UNK UNK article in two zero zero one UNK the UNK syndrome which is a point argued by many in the autism rights movement this article many UNK UNK is just one example of the UNK s UNK of mental UNK UNK to what is actually UNK normal behavior they argue that UNK lack of UNK ability or social UNK and intellectual interests even when they UNK UNK to others are not in themselves UNK of autism or asperger s syndrome others UNK that it is actually the UNK UNK which is UNK mental UNK UNK to children who in the past would have simply been accepted as a little different or even UNK UNK see UNK for further UNK of this issue due to the recent UNK UNK autism and autistic spectrum disorders an UNK number of UNK are UNK to seek UNK of high functioning autism or asperger s syndrome in UNK of UNK they UNK experience or UNK during childhood since the cause of autism is thought to be at least UNK UNK a UNK of these UNK seek their own diagnosis UNK as UNK up to their children s UNK because autism UNK into the pervasive developmental disorder UNK UNK UNK UNK must have been present in a given UNK before age seven in order to make a UNK diagnosis UNK UNK due to the UNK of autism there are many UNK of UNK that need to be considered when UNK it such as the culture which has UNK from autistic UNK UNK and UNK with one another in addition there are several UNK UNK within the autistic community sometimes in strong opposition to one another community and politics much like many other UNK in the world the autistic community itself has UNK off into several groups UNK these groups are those who seek a UNK for autism UNK UNK UNK those who do not desire a UNK for autism and as such UNK it UNK anti UNK and the many people UNK in the middle of the two in recent history with scientists UNK more about autism and UNK UNK UNK to a UNK some members of the anti UNK movement UNK a letter to the united nations UNK to be UNK as a UNK group rather than a group with a mental UNK or UNK UNK such as autistics UNK present the view of the anti UNK group there are numerous resources available for autistics from many groups due to the fact that many autistics find it UNK to UNK online than in person many of these resources are available online in addition sometimes successful autistic UNK in a local community will help out children with autism much in the way a UNK would help out an UNK for example two zero zero two was UNK autism awareness year in the united kingdom this idea was UNK by UNK and UNK UNK UNK of an autistic child UNK autism awareness year was led by the british institute of UNK UNK children UNK UNK national autistic society autism UNK and eight zero zero UNK in the united kingdom it had the personal UNK of british UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK of all UNK in the UNK of UNK culture with the recent UNK in autism UNK and new UNK to UNK and UNK autistics an autistic culture has UNK to develop similar to UNK culture autistic culture is based in a belief that autism is a UNK way of being and not a disorder to be UNK there are some UNK which are specific to autism in general as a culture not just autistic culture it is a common UNK that people with autism do not UNK many do get UNK often they UNK another person with autism although this is not always the case many times autistics are UNK to other autistics due to UNK interests or UNK but more often than not the UNK is due to UNK UNK with UNK UNK the same as is true for non autistics autistics who UNK have UNK that UNK is as important to autistics as it is to UNK UNK UNK autistic UNK have also UNK become a UNK more common the interests of autistic people and so called UNK or UNK can often UNK as autistic people can sometimes become

very UNK values for albedo because of the many human built UNK which UNK UNK before the UNK can UNK the surface in the northern part of the world cities are relatively UNK and UNK has UNK that their UNK albedo is about seven with only a UNK increase during the summer in most UNK countries cities UNK around one two this is similar to the values found in northern UNK UNK UNK part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in UNK UNK e g there are more very UNK UNK around another reason is that UNK of the UNK are very UNK and city UNK must be built with different UNK UNK UNK may also UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK so the UNK will UNK UNK UNK because UNK tend to have a low albedo UNK UNK would tend to increase albedo and UNK UNK the UNK UNK UNK further UNK the issue in UNK snow UNK UNK UNK UNK of UNK areas are one zero to five zero higher than UNK UNK areas because snow does not UNK the UNK as UNK studies by the UNK UNK have UNK the UNK generally UNK effect of albedo

UNK this is the basis for UNK of UNK UNK in the UNK and UNK snow UNK UNK as a result of global UNK UNK UNK are another source of albedo that play into the global UNK UNK different UNK of UNK have

philosophy into the UNK of western philosophy as we know it the writings of plato and aristotle founded two of the most important schools of ancient philosophy aristotle UNK knowledge UNK from the UNK and in modern terms would be UNK among the modern UNK see UNK and UNK he also UNK a UNK of UNK in the topics by UNK UNK to UNK from commonly held UNK UNK his goal being non UNK rather than UNK he set the UNK for what would eventually develop into the UNK UNK of scientific method centuries later although he wrote UNK early in his UNK no more than UNK of these have UNK the works of aristotle that still UNK today are in UNK form and were for the most part UNK UNK these were UNK UNK UNK or UNK used by his students and were almost UNK UNK UNK over the UNK of years as a result these works tend to be UNK UNK and UNK to UNK among the most important UNK are physics metaphysics or UNK UNK ethics politics de UNK on the soul and UNK these works although UNK in many UNK ways are very different in both style and UNK aristotle is known for being one of the few UNK in history who studied almost every subject possible at the time in science aristotle studied UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK physics and UNK in philosophy aristotle wrote on UNK ethics government metaphysics politics UNK UNK and UNK he also UNK with education foreign UNK literature and UNK his UNK works UNK UNK an UNK of greek knowledge UNK early life and studies at the academy a UNK of aristotle is a nearly UNK UNK in places of high culture in the west aristotle was born at UNK a UNK of UNK on the UNK UNK of UNK in three eight four bc his father UNK was court UNK to king UNK UNK of UNK it is believed that aristotle s UNK held this position under various UNK of the UNK as such aristotle s early education would UNK have UNK of UNK in medicine and UNK from his father about his mother UNK little is known it is known that she UNK early in aristotle s life when UNK also UNK in aristotle s UNK year he was left an UNK and

one eight he was UNK already UNK in the UNK of natural UNK from the age of one eight to three seven aristotle UNK in UNK as a UNK of plato and UNK himself at the academy the UNK between plato and aristotle have formed the subject of various UNK many of which UNK aristotle UNK no UNK there were UNK of UNK between plato who took his UNK on UNK UNK principles and aristotle who even at that time UNK a UNK for the UNK of the UNK and laws of the physical world it is also UNK that plato UNK that aristotle UNK UNK rather than UNK but not that there was an open UNK of UNK in fact aristotle s UNK after the death of plato his continued association with UNK and other UNK and his UNK in his writings to plato s UNK UNK that while there were UNK of UNK between plato and aristotle there was no lack of UNK UNK or UNK UNK UNK this the UNK that UNK aristotle UNK are UNK to the UNK who were known as UNK if such UNK were UNK UNK by UNK writers such as UNK UNK and UNK UNK the reason UNK in the UNK UNK aristotle was held in by the early christian UNK not in any well UNK historical tradition aristotle as philosopher and UNK after the death of plato three four seven bc aristotle was considered as the next head of the academy a position that was eventually UNK to plato s UNK aristotle then UNK with UNK to the court of UNK UNK of UNK in UNK UNK and UNK his UNK and adopted UNK UNK in three four four bc UNK was UNK in a rebellion and aristotle UNK with his family to UNK it is also UNK that he UNK on UNK and UNK UNK UNK research then one or two years later he was UNK to UNK the UNK capital by king UNK ii of UNK to become the UNK of alexander the great who was then one three UNK wrote that aristotle not only UNK to alexander a knowledge of ethics and politics but also of the most UNK UNK of philosophy we have much UNK that alexander UNK by UNK with the philosopher and that aristotle made UNK and UNK use of his influence over the young UNK although UNK UNK UNK this due to this influence alexander provided aristotle with UNK means for the UNK of books and the UNK of his scientific UNK it is possible that aristotle also UNK in the education of alexander s UNK friends which may have UNK for example UNK and UNK aristotle UNK a long UNK with UNK eventually UNK into a book UNK now lost according to UNK such as UNK and UNK UNK had aristotle s UNK of UNK UNK during the three four zero s bc and aristotle UNK UNK that alexander UNK it during his UNK of alexander aristotle was UNK considered a second time for UNK of the academy his UNK UNK was UNK UNK UNK and UNK of the UNK in about three three five bc alexander UNK for his UNK campaign and aristotle who had UNK as an UNK UNK more or less since alexander UNK the UNK UNK UNK to UNK and UNK his own school of philosophy he may as UNK UNK says have UNK a school of UNK during his former UNK in UNK but now following plato s example he gave UNK UNK in philosophy in a UNK UNK to UNK UNK from which his school has come to be known as the UNK it was also called the UNK school because aristotle UNK to UNK problems of philosophy with his UNK while UNK up and down UNK the UNK UNK UNK around the UNK during the UNK years three three five bc three two two bc which he UNK as UNK of the UNK aristotle UNK most of his writings UNK plato he wrote UNK in which his UNK were UNK in UNK popular language he also UNK the several UNK which will be mentioned below on physics metaphysics and so UNK in which the UNK is more UNK and the language more UNK than in the UNK these writings show to what good use he put the resources alexander had provided for him they show particularly how he UNK in UNK together the works of his UNK in greek philosophy and how he UNK either UNK or through others his UNK in the UNK of natural UNK UNK claimed that alexander UNK under aristotle s UNK all the UNK UNK and UNK of the UNK kingdom and all the UNK of the UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK and aristotle s works on UNK make this UNK more UNK aristotle was UNK UNK about the UNK of his UNK and UNK UNK that he was the first to UNK a great library during the last years of aristotle s life the UNK between him and alexander became very UNK UNK to the UNK and UNK of UNK UNK aristotle had UNK to alexander nevertheless aristotle continued to be UNK at UNK as a UNK of alexander and a UNK of UNK UNK when alexander s death became known in UNK and the UNK UNK which led to the UNK war aristotle UNK in the general UNK of the UNK the UNK of UNK which had been brought against UNK and UNK was now with even less reason brought against aristotle he left the city saying according to many ancient UNK that he would not give the UNK a chance to UNK a UNK time against philosophy he took up UNK at his country house at UNK in UNK and there he UNK the following year three two two bc his death was due to a UNK UNK of the UNK from which he had long UNK the story that his death was due to UNK UNK as well as the UNK that he UNK himself into the UNK because he could not UNK the UNK is without historical UNK very little is known about aristotle s personal UNK UNK from UNK UNK the UNK and UNK of aristotle UNK from the first years of the UNK school UNK him as UNK and UNK of UNK and UNK below the UNK UNK his character as UNK by his writings his will which is UNK UNK UNK of his UNK and the UNK of his UNK UNK was that of a high UNK kind UNK man UNK to his family and his friends kind to his slaves UNK to his UNK and UNK UNK towards his UNK when UNK UNK to UNK the world of christian UNK and the works of aristotle began to be studied without UNK and UNK the UNK of aristotle UNK to the christian writers of the one three th century as it had to the UNK UNK writers of his own day as UNK UNK UNK by UNK and UNK by any great moral UNK the UNK of those who know aristotle s UNK also had a UNK influence on islamic thought and philosophy during the middle ages the UNK of UNK UNK and UNK UNK UNK al UNK one were a few of the major UNK of the aristotelian school of thought during the UNK age of UNK UNK aristotle UNK philosophy in terms of UNK saying that philosophy is the science of the universal UNK of that which is UNK plato had defined it as the science of the idea meaning by idea what we should UNK the UNK basis of UNK both UNK and UNK UNK philosophy as UNK with the universal aristotle however UNK the universal in particular things and called it the UNK of things while plato UNK that the universal UNK UNK from particular things and is related to them as their UNK or UNK for aristotle therefore UNK method UNK the UNK from the study of particular UNK to the knowledge of UNK while for plato UNK method means the UNK from a knowledge of universal ideas to a UNK of particular UNK of those ideas in a certain sense aristotle s method is both UNK and UNK while plato s is UNK UNK in aristotle s UNK the term natural philosophy UNK to the UNK of the natural world which include UNK UNK and the laws of physics many centuries later these UNK would become the basis of modern science as studied through the scientific method in modern times the term philosophy has come to be more UNK UNK as metaphysics distinct from UNK study of the natural world UNK the physical sciences in contrast in aristotle s time and use philosophy was taken to UNK all UNK of intellectual UNK in the UNK sense of the word he makes philosophy UNK with UNK which he also called science note however that his use of the term science UNK a different meaning than that which is UNK by the scientific method all science UNK is either UNK UNK or theoretical by UNK science he UNK ethics and politics by UNK he means the study of UNK and the other UNK arts while by theoretical philosophy he means physics UNK and metaphysics the last philosophy in the UNK sense he UNK as the knowledge of UNK being and UNK it first philosophy the UNK science or of being in the UNK UNK of UNK if logic or as aristotle UNK it UNK be UNK as a study UNK to philosophy we have as UNK of aristotelian philosophy one logic two theoretical philosophy including metaphysics physics UNK three UNK philosophy and four UNK philosophy aristotle s UNK logic history aristotle says that on the subject of UNK he had UNK UNK on an earlier UNK to speak about UNK UNK one nine five one however plato reports that UNK was thought of before him by UNK of UNK who was UNK by the right use of words logic UNK to have UNK from UNK the earlier philosophers used concepts like UNK UNK UNK as a rule when UNK but never UNK its UNK UNK even plato had UNK with logic although he had the idea of UNK a system for UNK he was never able to UNK one UNK he UNK on his UNK which was a UNK between different sciences and methods UNK UNK one nine five one plato thought that UNK would simply UNK from UNK so he UNK on having good UNK so that the UNK would UNK later on plato UNK that a method for UNK the UNK would be UNK plato never UNK such a method but his best attempt was published in his book UNK where he UNK his UNK method UNK one nine six eight UNK and the UNK what we UNK today aristotelian logic aristotle himself would have UNK UNK the term logic he UNK to mean UNK most of aristotle s work is UNK not in its original form since it was most UNK edited by students and later UNK the UNK works of aristotle were UNK into six books at about the time of UNK UNK on UNK prior UNK UNK UNK topics on UNK UNK the order of the books or the UNK from which they are UNK is not certain but this list was UNK from analysis of aristotle s writings there is one volume of aristotle s UNK logic not found in the UNK UNK the UNK book of metaphysics UNK UNK one nine five one UNK logic aristotle is also the UNK of UNK with UNK UNK logic the word UNK UNK to the word UNK UNK the fact that UNK logic UNK with the UNK of UNK aristotle UNK the UNK of UNK and possible UNK he UNK a logic which UNK in the UNK of UNK but which was very UNK to UNK UNK one nine six eight science aristotle by UNK UNK aristotelian UNK about science had only been UNK not UNK by the modern UNK of the term aristotelian philosophy was not science as this UNK did not attempt to UNK how the world actually UNK through UNK for example in his book the history of animals he claimed that human UNK have more UNK than UNK had he only made some UNK he would have discovered that this claim is UNK rather based on what one s UNK UNK one aristotelian philosophy then UNK upon the UNK that man s mind could UNK all the laws of the universe based on UNK UNK without UNK through reason UNK one of the UNK for this was that aristotle held that physics was about UNK objects with a UNK of their own UNK UNK was about UNK objects without a UNK of their own in this philosophy he could not UNK that there was a relationship between them in contrast today s science UNK that UNK UNK often UNK people UNK and therefore one must UNK one s ideas to the UNK world through UNK only then can one see if one s ideas are based in UNK this position is known as UNK or the scientific method although aristotle UNK an important UNK in the history of scientific method by UNK logic as a UNK science he also left behind a UNK of UNK UNK that we may UNK in UNK of the metaphysics his UNK would UNK much UNK up until the one five zero zero s where UNK and UNK began to UNK out that europe is not the center of the universe from the three UNK century to the one five zero zero s the UNK view held that the earth was the center of the universe at this late UNK it is UNK that the earth is not even the center of our own UNK system in UNK of aristotle s UNK UNK of the UNK and UNK he is a UNK character in the history of metaphysics both in terms of the UNK of the word as well as a UNK within metaphysics as a discipline UNK the UNK next to the physics by UNK of UNK metaphysics became UNK to the idea of UNK the physical by UNK a UNK on aristotle UNK had published aristotle s works UNK around four three two zero bc so UNK the UNK of metaphysics was simply that which is next to the physics aristotle s metaphysics UNK UNK is the first who saw that all causes of things are UNK that we have scientific knowledge when we know the cause that to know a thing s UNK is to know the reason for its UNK UNK the UNK for all the UNK UNK theories by UNK the number nature principles elements UNK order and UNK of UNK aristotle s UNK of the causes of things is the most UNK theory up to now according to aristotle s theory all the causes UNK into several UNK the total number of which UNK to the ways the question UNK may be UNK UNK by reference to the matter or the UNK the UNK the UNK the form or the UNK to the primary UNK change or the UNK and its action and to the goal the UNK the end or the good UNK the major UNK of causes come under the following UNK the material cause is that from which a thing UNK into UNK as from its parts UNK UNK or UNK this UNK the UNK of causes to the parts UNK elements UNK UNK UNK the whole system UNK UNK UNK UNK or UNK the part whole UNK the UNK cause UNK us what a thing is that any thing is UNK by the UNK form UNK UNK whole UNK or UNK it UNK the UNK of causes in terms of UNK principles or general laws as the whole UNK is the cause of its parts the whole part UNK the UNK cause is that from which the change or the UNK of the change first UNK it UNK what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is UNK and so UNK all UNK of UNK UNK or living UNK as the UNK of change or movement or UNK UNK the current understanding of UNK as the UNK of cause and effect this UNK the modern UNK of cause as either the UNK or UNK or particular UNK or states of UNK the final cause is that for the UNK of which a thing UNK or is UNK including both UNK and UNK actions and activities the final cause or UNK is the purpose or end that something is UNK to UNK or it is that from which and that to which the change is this also UNK modern ideas of mental UNK UNK such psychological causes as UNK need UNK or UNK rational UNK ethical all that UNK purpose to behavior UNK things can be causes of one another UNK each other UNK as UNK work causes UNK and UNK UNK although not in the same way or UNK the one is as the UNK of change the other as the goal thus aristotle first UNK a UNK or UNK UNK as a UNK of UNK UNK or action or influence of cause and effect also aristotle UNK that the same thing can be the cause of UNK effects its UNK and UNK may result in different UNK UNK aristotle UNK two UNK of UNK UNK prior UNK and UNK chance UNK all causes UNK and UNK can be UNK as potential or as UNK particular or UNK the same language UNK to the effects of causes so that UNK effects UNK to UNK causes particular effects to particular causes UNK causes to UNK effects UNK UNK does not UNK a UNK UNK between the cause and the effect all further UNK of UNK will be UNK in UNK the UNK UNK on the order causes like as final UNK material UNK UNK or in UNK all UNK to the material and UNK causes or to the UNK UNK UNK or chance or just to UNK UNK and UNK of natural UNK the natural sciences UNK how things UNK UNK of UNK the UNK and UNK chance and UNK UNK and chance are causes of effects chance as an UNK cause UNK in the UNK of UNK things it is from what is UNK but note that what is UNK does not come from chance for a better understanding of aristotle s UNK of chance it might be better to UNK of UNK something UNK place by chance if a person UNK out with the UNK of having one thing take place but with the result of another thing not UNK taking place for example a person UNK UNK that person may find another person UNK to UNK a UNK UNK however if the person UNK the UNK UNK the person UNK not for the purpose of UNK UNK but for some other purpose aristotle would UNK the UNK of the UNK by that particular UNK a result of chance it must be UNK that something UNK by chance in other words if something UNK all or most of the time we cannot say that it is by chance however chance can only UNK to human UNK it is in the UNK of moral actions according to aristotle chance must UNK UNK and thus UNK and only humans are capable of UNK and UNK what is not capable of action cannot do UNK by chance physics two six the five elements fire which is UNK and UNK earth which is UNK and UNK air which is UNK and UNK water which is UNK and UNK UNK which is the UNK UNK that makes up the UNK these four elements UNK i e fire air water earth etc while UNK is on its own the UNK UNK this UNK going god UNK the UNK going and thus the UNK is UNK aristotle s ethics although aristotle wrote several works on ethics the major one was the UNK ethics which is considered one of aristotle s greatest works it UNK UNK the UNK books which UNK it are based on UNK from his UNK at the UNK and were either edited by or UNK to aristotle s son UNK aristotle believed that ethical knowledge is not certain knowledge like metaphysics and UNK but general knowledge also as it is a UNK discipline rather than a theoretical one he thought that in order to become good one could not simply study what UNK is one must actually do UNK UNK in order to do this aristotle had first to UNK what was UNK he began by UNK that UNK was UNK with some goal in mind and that goal is good the UNK goal he called the UNK good aristotle UNK that UNK could not be found only in UNK or only in UNK and UNK he finally UNK UNK by UNK the specific UNK of man but what is this UNK that will UNK UNK to UNK this aristotle UNK the soul and found it to have three parts the UNK soul UNK animals and humans the UNK soul animals and humans and the rational soul humans only thus a human s UNK is to do what makes it human to be good at what UNK it UNK from UNK UNK the ability to reason or UNK a person that does this is the UNK because they are UNK their purpose or nature as found in the rational soul UNK on how well they did this aristotle said people UNK to one of four UNK the UNK the UNK the UNK and the UNK aristotle believes that every ethical UNK is an UNK UNK between UNK and UNK this does not mean aristotle believed in moral UNK however he set certain UNK e g UNK UNK UNK UNK etc and certain actions e g UNK UNK UNK etc as always UNK UNK of the UNK or the UNK UNK ethics in UNK ethics aristotle UNK on the UNK of UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK rather than UNK specific good actions this can be UNK with UNK ethics in which the primary focus is on individual action UNK ethics UNK the UNK of context to ethical UNK what might be right in one UNK might be UNK in another aristotle believed that UNK is the end of life and that as long as a person is UNK for UNK good UNK will result from that UNK making the person UNK and therefore UNK aristotle s UNK plato left and aristotle right a UNK of the school of UNK a UNK by UNK aristotle UNK to the earth UNK his belief in knowledge through UNK UNK and experience UNK plato UNK up to the UNK UNK his belief in the UNK UNK aristotle has been UNK on several UNK his analysis of UNK is UNK UNK on the UNK that it UNK an active UNK UNK UNK UNK life to an UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK it is on these UNK that some feminist UNK UNK to aristotle as a UNK at times the UNK that aristotle UNK against the UNK of his own UNK plato appear to UNK on UNK UNK of those UNK although aristotle UNK against plato that knowledge of the world could only be UNK through experience he UNK UNK to take his own UNK aristotle UNK UNK of UNK UNK UNK but often UNK into UNK UNK UNK with the result that his work was UNK with UNK that were not supported by UNK evidence for example his UNK that objects of different UNK UNK at different UNK under UNK which was later UNK by john UNK UNK is often given to UNK even though UNK UNK centuries earlier in the middle ages UNK from the one two th century to the one five th century the philosophy of aristotle became UNK established UNK although aristotle himself was far from UNK in his approach to philosophical UNK two aspects of his philosophy might have UNK its UNK into UNK his works were UNK UNK and UNK so that they could give the UNK that no significant matter had been left UNK he was also much less UNK to UNK the UNK methods of his UNK UNK and plato some UNK have UNK that aristotle was UNK of much of the current science of his own time aristotle was called not a great philosopher but the philosopher by UNK UNK these UNK UNK aristotelian philosophy with UNK UNK the thought of ancient UNK into the middle ages it UNK a UNK of some aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the UNK of modern scientific laws and UNK methods the UNK of his works though we know that aristotle wrote many UNK UNK UNK described his UNK style as a river of gold the UNK have been lost in time all that we have now are the UNK UNK for his UNK which are often UNK to UNK the UNK ethics is a good example it is now believed that we have about one UNK of his original works aristotle UNK the UNK of his written work for UNK he thus never published his books UNK from his UNK the story of the original UNK of his UNK is described by UNK in his UNK and UNK in his UNK lives UNK the UNK were left from aristotle to UNK from UNK to UNK of UNK from UNK to his UNK their UNK UNK

the UNK UNK behind george UNK UNK s development of the UNK UNK which is a UNK UNK used to study UNK evolution an UNK example of altruism is found in the UNK UNK UNK such as UNK UNK these UNK live as individual UNK until UNK at which point they UNK and form a UNK UNK body in which some UNK UNK themselves to UNK the UNK of other UNK in the UNK body social behavior and altruism UNK many UNK to the UNK between the many parts UNK UNK of an UNK but are UNK by the ability of each individual to UNK UNK without an UNK UNK for its UNK altruism in UNK and UNK if one UNK an act UNK to others with a view to UNK some personal benefit then it is not an UNK UNK act there are several different UNK on how benefit or interest should be defined a material UNK e g money a physical UNK etc is UNK a form of benefit while others UNK and include both material and UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK etc as being UNK UNK UNK according to psychological egoism while people can UNK altruistic behavior they cannot have altruistic UNK psychological UNK would say that while they might very well UNK their lives UNK others with no material benefit or a material UNK UNK to themselves their most UNK UNK for doing so is always to further their own interests for example it would be UNK that the UNK UNK behind a person UNK this way is to UNK their own psychological well being good UNK UNK of this theory often UNK it on the UNK that it is non UNK in other words it is UNK in such a way as to be UNK to UNK or UNK because UNK UNK such as a good UNK cannot be UNK or UNK to UNK in all people UNK altruistic acts psychological egoism has also been UNK of using UNK logic if a person UNK UNK an act that means he UNK personal UNK from it therefore people only UNK acts that give them personal UNK this UNK is UNK because its UNK is UNK to its UNK it UNK that people only UNK acts that give them personal UNK and UNK that people only UNK acts that give them personal UNK in contrast to psychological egoism the UNK altruism UNK states that when an individual UNK UNK towards UNK in need the individual will then be UNK UNK to help that person that is the individual will be UNK UNK about that person s UNK not his or her own in common UNK altruism usually means UNK another person without UNK material UNK from that or other UNK although it may well UNK the UNK benefit of a good UNK sense of UNK self UNK UNK of duty whether UNK by a religion or UNK or simply one s UNK or the like in this way one need not UNK on the UNK of the UNK in question humans are not UNK altruistic towards family members UNK co UNK or potential future UNK but can be altruistic towards people they UNK t know and will never UNK for example humans UNK to international UNK and UNK their time to help society s less UNK it UNK UNK to claim that these altruistic UNK are UNK in the UNK of a UNK UNK the game theory analysis of this just in case strategy where the UNK would be always help UNK in case you need to UNK in a UNK in UNK is a UNK non UNK strategy where the UNK UNK of effort UNK is far UNK than the UNK UNK when it UNK UNK off UNK according to some it is UNK to believe that these UNK are UNK UNK as UNK UNK UNK be it UNK or UNK UNK UNK UNK of UNK UNK along the UNK of the UNK s UNK are UNK as far as they go but what a game UNK UNK UNK over is the fact that altruistic behavior can be UNK to that UNK UNK UNK the UNK one recent UNK UNK by the philosopher UNK UNK was UNK developed when UNK the UNK of so called free UNK in the UNK of the UNK a UNK UNK UNK of the UNK s UNK in game theory terms a free UNK is an UNK who UNK UNK from a co UNK society without UNK in a one to one UNK free UNK can UNK be UNK by a UNK for UNK strategy but in a UNK UNK society where UNK and UNK are UNK and UNK they can be UNK UNK to UNK off UNK an UNK society of co UNK UNK co UNK UNK UNK with each other each UNK resources and each UNK on the common good now UNK a UNK free UNK an UNK who UNK a UNK you UNK my back and later UNK to UNK it the UNK is that free UNK is always going to be UNK to individuals at UNK to society how can well UNK co UNK UNK UNK being UNK over many UNK one UNK UNK is for co UNK to UNK the ability to UNK potential free UNK in UNK and UNK to UNK into UNK UNK with them then the UNK free UNK UNK is to UNK a more UNK UNK UNK co UNK into co UNK after all this can lead to an UNK UNK UNK with ever more UNK UNK and ever more UNK UNK in this UNK UNK race how best might one UNK UNK that one UNK is a UNK co UNK not a free UNK in UNK one UNK is by actually making UNK a UNK co UNK by UNK psychological UNK to UNK UNK and by UNK this fact to UNK UNK in other words a good UNK is for UNK to UNK things that UNK UNK will force them to be co UNK and to make it UNK that they UNK UNK these things so evolution will UNK UNK who are UNK moral and who UNK their UNK on their UNK in short evolution will give rise to the UNK of UNK this theory UNK with ideas of UNK UNK and the one to one UNK of UNK may UNK how a UNK and UNK UNK process can UNK a UNK non UNK form of altruism that UNK rise to the human UNK UNK of such UNK game theory analysis point out that it appears to UNK that human UNK are rational and UNK to UNK an analysis of human UNK without including human UNK or UNK is UNK UNK UNK and UNK human UNK as if they are UNK UNK sometimes called UNK UNK another UNK is that often people UNK UNK so that it is UNK to UNK if they UNK did the altruistic act UNK with an understanding that rational human UNK benefit from living in a UNK universe UNK it UNK that particular human UNK may UNK UNK UNK UNK from acts which they UNK to make the world a better place UNK of altruism and UNK for UNK UNK the UNK strategy UNK for UNK in the UNK UNK s UNK UNK game UNK argue that UNK for UNK is much more successful in UNK UNK UNK among individuals than altruism defined as UNK UNK can ever be UNK for UNK UNK with UNK in the first UNK as altruism does and then just UNK the UNK of the UNK UNK by UNK if the UNK UNK then he UNK him with UNK if he UNK t then he UNK him by not UNK in the next UNK UNK with many UNK that UNK to UNK or UNK UNK of others this UNK strategy UNK UNK to be the most successful see the evolution of UNK it was even more successful than these UNK UNK while UNK UNK altruism was one of the most UNK UNK UNK with altruistic UNK UNK for UNK is UNK from UNK altruism robert UNK and richard UNK also UNK that altruism may be UNK to society by UNK UNK and UNK and making them more and more UNK until they can force UNK to UNK UNK which is not the case for UNK for UNK see also UNK of UNK and UNK in the context of UNK the UNK for UNK strategy is also called UNK altruism altruism in politics there is UNK a UNK UNK as to the UNK of the section UNK below if one is an UNK to the ethical doctrine called altruism that people have an ethical obligation to help or further the UNK of others then one will support the kind of politics that one believes to be most UNK in UNK the UNK of others UNK of the effect this may have on UNK since there is no general UNK on what kind of politics UNK in the greatest benefit for others different UNK may have very different political views with UNK to their political UNK UNK may be divided in two UNK groups those who believe altruism is a matter of personal UNK and therefore UNK can and should be UNK and those who believe that altruism is a moral UNK which should be UNK if possible by all human UNK a prominent example of the former branch of UNK political thought is UNK UNK who in natural law UNK man no UNK UNK many other moral UNK to his UNK men such as to UNK the UNK UNK the UNK UNK the UNK UNK for the UNK UNK the UNK UNK the UNK and UNK the UNK but these are simply moral UNK of which each man must be his own UNK in each particular case as to whether and how and how far he can or will UNK them the UNK branch of UNK political thought on the other UNK UNK that egoism should be UNK UNK and that UNK have a duty not only to help other people but to UNK those people to help each other as well thus in politics these UNK almost always take a left UNK UNK UNK from UNK social UNK to UNK or even communism UNK UNK of this branch may argue for the UNK of UNK UNK government UNK UNK at UNK the UNK for example UNK UNK such as social UNK or public UNK and public education less UNK things such as a law that UNK UNK over to UNK UNK UNK UNK may also be UNK by UNK to the altruism UNK finally UNK UNK of this branch may take things further and UNK some form of UNK or UNK on a UNK related note altruism is often held even by non UNK to be the kind of UNK that should UNK the actions of UNK and other people in UNK of power such people are usually expected to set their own interests UNK and UNK the UNK when they do not they may be UNK as UNK on what is believed to be an ethical obligation to place the interests of others above their own UNK often speak of a moral obligation of individuals to help others for example george UNK UNK to the united nations said we have a moral obligation to help others and a moral duty to make UNK our actions are UNK if one is an UNK to the ethical doctrine called altruism that people have an ethical obligation to help or further the UNK of others it can become a moral UNK for UNK or UNK UNK individuals to help others in the UNK of politics the UNK may UNK an UNK in the form of government to UNK this UNK moral obligation this is not to say that an ethical UNK will UNK force this on UNK an UNK may UNK others the UNK to UNK in a UNK they believe to be UNK or UNK in other words their ethical doctrine would not UNK itself UNK with UNK those who believe UNK is a moral obligation UNK may be divided in two UNK groups those who believe UNK others is a moral obligation but should not be UNK on individuals and those who believe that since UNK others is a moral obligation UNK individuals to help others if they are not UNK on their own is UNK a prominent example of the former branch of UNK political thought is UNK UNK who in natural law UNK man no UNK UNK many other moral UNK to his UNK men such as to UNK the UNK UNK the UNK UNK the UNK UNK for the UNK UNK the UNK UNK the UNK and UNK the UNK but these are simply moral UNK of which each man must be his own UNK in each particular case as to whether and how and how far he can or will UNK them the UNK branch of UNK political thought

or even communism UNK UNK of this branch may argue for the UNK of UNK UNK government UNK UNK at UNK the UNK for example UNK UNK such as social UNK or public UNK and public education finally UNK UNK of this branch may take things to an UNK and UNK some form of state UNK UNK UNK or communism this is in line with UNK UNK s philosophy who UNK the term altruism which UNK against individual rights finally many believe that UNK others or UNK society is not a moral obligation at all but that UNK is an UNK UNK not UNK UNK these UNK all government UNK UNK UNK anarchist UNK joseph proudhon in one

the UNK hero a man whose ability and independence causes conflict with the UNK but who UNK nevertheless to UNK his values rand UNK this hero as the UNK and the UNK goal of her fiction was to UNK such UNK she believed that man must UNK his values and actions by reason that the individual has a right to UNK for his own UNK UNK UNK self to others UNK others to self and that no one has the right to

of the individual s UNK mind in human life it is a highly philosophical and UNK story that UNK with UNK of rand s own objectivism though she was not UNK known as a philosopher when it was written whether or not she had philosophical UNK and to what UNK or sense the novel is an UNK are controversial UNK in fact the ideas behind the book and their UNK as well as its UNK UNK have made it one of the most controversial novels of the two zero th century it is also one of the UNK novels ever written UNK one UNK UNK or more UNK on the UNK philosophy and writing the UNK of atlas shrugged is that independent rational thought is the motor that powers the world in the book men of the mind go on UNK UNK the UNK of what only they UNK together a UNK UNK rand claims that humans particularly those whose UNK work UNK from mental effort may UNK UNK UNK human UNK is UNK given no UNK they UNK themselves from the looters the UNK is an UNK the rational men like the greek god atlas UNK the world on their UNK in the form of a UNK they have UNK to UNK the book is UNK in objectivism the philosophical system founded by rand rand UNK that society UNK when independence and individual UNK are UNK or UNK and that UNK a society will become more UNK as it UNK UNK and UNK independence and individual UNK rand believed that independence UNK to the UNK that people are free and that UNK is UNK best when

and communism or indeed any form of state UNK in UNK UNK as UNK UNK however rand claimed that it is not a UNK political book but that the politics UNK in the novel are a result of her attempt to UNK her image of the UNK man and the position of the human mind in society rand UNK that independence and individual UNK UNK the world and should be UNK her UNK UNK a rational moral code she UNK the UNK

UNK humans in every form that they take we are UNK to see the UNK spectrum of human UNK and UNK UNK to learn the range of UNK all the ways that we can be human by UNK humans in their every UNK and UNK those UNK to each other we can UNK what is possible for humans and what is UNK for humans two UNK anthropology UNK to UNK every part of culture to every other part it UNK that the various parts of culture are UNK to each other and that certain UNK tend to UNK or not to UNK for example there are no UNK and UNK cultures that UNK UNK in cities that s just UNK we are also UNK in how a people s cultures is UNK to their environment UNK without high technology you are not going to see UNK or cities in the middle of the UNK or the UNK three UNK this is the most UNK UNK controversial part of the anthropological UNK UNK means that the UNK or UNK or values of a culture are UNK to that specific culture in other words say UNK may be normal or UNK in one culture but UNK may be normal or UNK in another the point is that different cultures believe different things or value different things or even mean different things with UNK UNK UNK UNK or objects when you go to another culture or even just UNK with another culture for example when you are doing international business you cannot UNK that other people understand things the same way you do in fact you should UNK that they UNK t anthropology UNK against UNK UNK of a new culture aspects that a western UNK may find UNK or UNK can be UNK when UNK within that culture s history and UNK understanding of the world there will be a UNK for the UNK it may be rational however according to a cultural logic that UNK with western UNK UNK s UNK of UNK to understand the native point of view remains UNK to UNK cultural anthropology today the point is that if we UNK to understand other people UNK we must see what their UNK or words or concepts mean to them not what they would mean to us meaning is UNK to the culture that UNK that meaning this is not to say that all things are true or even that all things are good cultural UNK does not UNK UNK moral UNK indeed the american anthropological association s UNK support one nine four eight one nine nine seven for the universal UNK of human rights as well as work by UNK UNK UNK UNK the UNK is not a common anthropological point of view how does anthropology study culture one other way that anthropology is UNK among the sciences that study humans is by its UNK on UNK you cannot get to know another culture just by UNK about it or UNK UNK about it at best you could learn what other people have already discovered but you could not learn UNK new so anthropology UNK actually going to that society and living within their culture as much as possible this is called UNK UNK this UNK UNK on UNK UNK UNK UNK within the society who will UNK you their culture s UNK of social UNK and include you in their activities then as much as possible you will UNK to UNK their UNK speak their language and live their lives often actually UNK with a family in that society it is not UNK work and it is not always UNK but there is no better way to learn anthropological fields and UNK UNK

of UNK UNK UNK survey in one nine four nine in the UNK valley of UNK UNK and survey of all UNK became prominent with the rise of UNK archaeology some years later survey work has many UNK if UNK as a UNK UNK to or even in place of excavation it UNK relatively little time and UNK because it does not UNK UNK large UNK of soil to search out UNK nevertheless UNK a large UNK or site can be UNK so archaeologists often UNK UNK methods it UNK ethical issues of particular UNK to UNK UNK associated with UNK a site through excavation it is the only way to UNK some forms of information such as UNK

the UNK to UNK what UNK and features were UNK used together and which may be from different UNK of UNK for example excavation of a site UNK its UNK if a site was UNK by a UNK of distinct cultures UNK from more recent cultures will UNK above those from more ancient cultures excavation is the most UNK UNK of archaeological research also as a UNK process it UNK ethical UNK as a result very few sites are UNK in their UNK UNK is even more important in excavation than in survey it is common for large UNK UNK such as UNK UNK to be used in excavation especially to UNK the UNK UNK though this method is increasingly used with great UNK following this rather UNK UNK the UNK area is usually UNK UNK with UNK or UNK to UNK that all features are UNK the next UNK is to form a site UNK and then use it to

site black and white and UNK UNK of them are taken and UNK UNK are UNK in UNK the context of each all this information UNK as a UNK UNK of the now UNK archaeology and is used in UNK and UNK the site post excavation analysis UNK UNK and UNK have been UNK or UNK from surface UNK it is UNK to UNK study them to UNK as much data as possible this process is known as post excavation analysis and is UNK the most time UNK part of the archaeological UNK it is not UNK for the final excavation reports on major sites to take years to be published at its most UNK the UNK found are UNK UNK and UNK to published UNK in order to UNK them UNK and to UNK other sites with similar UNK UNK however a much more UNK range of UNK techniques are available through archaeological science meaning that UNK can be UNK and their UNK UNK the UNK UNK and UNK UNK from a site can all be UNK using the techniques of UNK UNK and UNK while any UNK can usually be UNK these techniques UNK provide information that would not UNK be known and therefore UNK UNK to the understanding of a site history of archaeology main article history of archaeology the history of archaeology has been one of UNK UNK and the use of an

or UNK UNK UNK it was only in the one nine th century that the UNK study of the past through its physical remains began to be UNK out archaeological methods were developed by both UNK UNK and UNK including UNK UNK UNK and william UNK UNK this process was continued in the two zero th century by such people as UNK UNK whose highly UNK approach to excavation UNK UNK the UNK of evidence that could be UNK during the two zero th century the development of UNK archaeology and then UNK archaeology have been important UNK as has the development of archaeological science which has UNK increased the amount of data that it is possible to UNK archaeological theory main article archaeological theory there is no single theory of archaeology and even UNK are UNK until the UNK two zero th century and the UNK of technology there was a general UNK that archaeology was closely related to both history and anthropology the first major UNK in the history of archaeological theory is commonly referred to as cultural or culture history which was developed during the late one nine th and early two zero th centuries in the one nine six zero s a number of young UNK american archaeologists such as UNK UNK UNK against the UNK of cultural history they UNK a new archaeology which would be more scientific and anthropological with UNK UNK and the scientific method very important parts of what became known as UNK archaeology in the one nine eight zero s a new movement UNK led by the british archaeologists UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK it UNK UNK s UNK to science and UNK and UNK the UNK of UNK UNK known as post UNK archaeology however this approach has been UNK by UNK as UNK scientific UNK the UNK of both UNK and post UNK is still under UNK archaeological theory now UNK from a UNK range of UNK including UNK UNK UNK thought UNK UNK UNK theory UNK science UNK UNK based and feminist archaeology and systems theory public archaeology early archaeology was largely an attempt to UNK UNK UNK and

UNK UNK as the UNK for them to UNK the field archaeologists are also very much UNK on public support the question of UNK who they are doing their work for is often UNK without a strong public interest in the subject often UNK by significant UNK and UNK archaeologists it would be a great UNK UNK for archaeologists to UNK the political and financial support they UNK in the UNK popular archaeology UNK such as time UNK and UNK the UNK have UNK in a UNK UNK in public interest where possible archaeologists now make more UNK for public UNK and UNK in UNK UNK than they UNK did however the UNK towards

alchemy was one of the main UNK of modern sciences and we UNK to the ancient alchemists the UNK of many UNK and UNK that are the UNK of modern chemical and UNK UNK UNK the alchemist by UNK william UNK douglas alchemy as a UNK science the common UNK of alchemists is that they were UNK scientists UNK and UNK who UNK to UNK lead into gold believed that the universe was UNK of the four elements of

simply UNK to make sense of a subject which as we now know was far UNK the UNK of their UNK these people were UNK UNK scientists who UNK to UNK and UNK the nature of chemical UNK and UNK they had to UNK on UNK UNK traditional know how UNK of UNK and UNK of UNK thought to UNK in the UNK UNK in UNK knowledge given these UNK the UNK character of alchemy is UNK UNK to the early alchemist chemical UNK could only UNK like UNK UNK UNK by UNK laws whose potential and UNK he had no way of UNK having discovered that a specific UNK could UNK an earth like UNK into UNK metal it was only natural to UNK that some different UNK could UNK a metal into another at the same time it was UNK to the alchemists that something was generally being UNK in chemical UNK even in the most UNK changes of physical state and UNK i e that UNK UNK some principles that could be UNK under many UNK forms and UNK by UNK UNK throughout the history of the discipline alchemists UNK very UNK to understand the nature of

UNK and UNK the alchemists UNK to make UNK UNK in the understanding of the natural world to them we UNK the UNK of many important UNK and chemical UNK which UNK the way for the modern science of chemistry and are still the UNK of today s chemical and UNK UNK alchemy as a philosophical and UNK discipline the best known goals of the alchemists were the UNK of common UNK into gold or UNK and the UNK of a UNK a UNK that UNK would UNK all UNK and UNK life UNK UNK with the middle ages european alchemists UNK much effort on the search for the philosopher s stone a UNK UNK that was believed to be an UNK UNK for either or both of those goals alchemists UNK UNK and support through the centuries though not for their UNK of those UNK goals UNK the UNK and philosophical UNK that UNK their

of UNK UNK the water of life was a UNK popular UNK among european alchemists on the other UNK alchemists never had the intellectual UNK UNK the UNK to separate the physical chemical aspects of their UNK from the UNK UNK indeed from UNK until well into the modern age a physics UNK of UNK UNK would have been as UNK as a metaphysics UNK of physical UNK for one thing the lack of common words for chemical concepts and UNK as well as the need for UNK led alchemists to UNK the terms and UNK of UNK and UNK UNK UNK UNK and other UNK and UNK fields so that even the UNK chemical UNK UNK up UNK like an UNK UNK UNK UNK alchemists UNK in those fields the theoretical UNK into which they could UNK their UNK collection of UNK UNK UNK UNK with the middle ages some alchemists increasingly came to view these UNK aspects as the true UNK of alchemy and chemical UNK physical states and material UNK as UNK UNK for UNK UNK states and UNK thus both the UNK of common UNK into gold and the universal UNK UNK evolution from an UNK UNK UNK and UNK state towards a UNK UNK UNK and UNK state and the philosopher s stone then represented some UNK UNK that would make this evolution possible UNK to the alchemist himself the UNK goal UNK his evolution from UNK to UNK and the stone represented some UNK UNK UNK or power that would lead to that goal in UNK that are written according to this view the UNK

these UNK and UNK UNK as the UNK and most UNK UNK of alchemy and even claim that the development of chemistry out of alchemy was a UNK of the original UNK tradition this is the view UNK by UNK UNK of UNK alchemy most scientists on the other UNK tend to take UNK the UNK view to them the UNK from the material UNK of alchemy to modern chemistry was the UNK UNK in the evolution of the discipline while the UNK UNK UNK of alchemy was a UNK UNK that led to UNK in either view however the UNK UNK UNK of some UNK or the UNK UNK UNK by others should not UNK the UNK of the more UNK alchemists alchemy and UNK since its UNK times alchemy has been closely UNK to UNK which in UNK and europe generally UNK the traditional UNK greek school of UNK alchemical systems often UNK that each of the seven UNK known

UNK and its UNK of cultural influence and western alchemy whose center has UNK over the UNK between egypt UNK and UNK the islamic world and finally back to europe chinese alchemy was closely UNK to UNK UNK western alchemy developed its own philosophical system with only UNK UNK to the major western UNK it is still an open question whether these two UNK UNK a common UNK or to what UNK they influenced each other alchemy in ancient egypt the UNK of western alchemy may generally be UNK to ancient UNK egypt UNK and UNK were UNK UNK together in the ancient world as the UNK of UNK UNK into UNK metal must have UNK to be an act of UNK UNK by UNK UNK it is claimed therefore that alchemy in ancient egypt was the UNK of the UNK class UNK alchemy is known UNK through the writings of ancient

UNK was a UNK UNK who in ancient times UNK the great university of UNK UNK his famous book UNK is a famous example of early indian medicine in traditional indian UNK UNK UNK UNK as UNK and UNK was said to have developed a method to UNK the UNK into gold much of his original writings are lost to us but his UNK still have strong influence on traditional indian medicine UNK to this day alchemy in the greek world the greek city of UNK in egypt was a center of greek alchemical knowledge and UNK its UNK through most of the greek and roman UNK the UNK UNK the UNK UNK of the UNK and UNK with them the UNK of UNK UNK and UNK UNK philosophy is UNK the belief that UNK rule the universe UNK from the UNK of UNK UNK and UNK UNK like UNK or UNK from which a UNK could be UNK UNK thought was based on the belief that the universe could be UNK through UNK on natural UNK this philosophy is believed to have UNK with UNK and his UNK UNK and later developed by plato and aristotle whose works came to be an UNK part of alchemy according to this belief the universe can be described by a few UNK natural laws that can be UNK only through UNK UNK and UNK philosophical UNK the UNK UNK UNK to UNK philosophy by the UNK was UNK a belief UNK in the christian and early post christian roman empire that the world is UNK because it was created in a UNK UNK and that UNK about the nature of UNK matter would lead to UNK they further believed that god did not UNK the universe in the UNK sense but that the universe was created from him but was UNK in the process rather than UNK UNK by the UNK of UNK and UNK i e original UNK according to UNK belief by UNK the UNK nature or the UNK of the world one UNK the true god UNK do not seek UNK from UNK but UNK seek to UNK UNK UNK that UNK is UNK a UNK of UNK UNK and UNK UNK theories about UNK and the UNK of god were also UNK one very important concept UNK at this time UNK by UNK and developed by aristotle was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements earth air water and fire according to aristotle each UNK had a UNK to which it UNK and to which it would UNK if left UNK the four elements of the greek were UNK UNK aspects of matter not UNK as our modern elements are true alchemy never UNK earth air water and fire as UNK or chemical UNK in the present day sense of the word the four elements are simply the primary and most general UNK by means of which the UNK and UNK UNK UNK of all UNK first UNK itself in UNK form later alchemists if plato and aristotle can be called alchemists UNK developed the UNK aspects of this concept alchemy in the roman empire the UNK adopted greek alchemy and metaphysics just as they adopted much of greek knowledge and philosophy by the end of the roman empire the greek alchemical philosophy had been UNK to the UNK of the UNK to UNK the UNK of UNK however the development of UNK in the empire brought a UNK line of UNK UNK from UNK three five four four three zero UNK an early christian philosopher who wrote of his UNK UNK before the UNK of the roman empire in UNK he UNK that reason and UNK could be used to understand god but UNK philosophy was evil there is also present in the soul by means of these same UNK sense a kind of UNK UNK and UNK which UNK not at taking UNK in the UNK but at UNK experience through the UNK and this UNK UNK he is UNK by the names of UNK and science UNK ideas were UNK anti UNK UNK when aristotelian UNK techniques were made available to the west they were not UNK still UNK thought was well UNK in UNK society and was used to show alchemy as being UNK UNK much of the roman knowledge of alchemy like that of the UNK and UNK is now lost in UNK the UNK of alchemical studies in the roman empire the art was mainly UNK and in the interests of UNK little was UNK to UNK UNK the use of UNK to mean UNK it is possible that some writing was UNK in UNK and that it was UNK lost or UNK in UNK and the UNK UNK that UNK alchemy in the islamic world after the UNK of the

UNK will also in the UNK of the UNK take off so much of the UNK of the body that human life may be UNK for many centuries the idea of UNK was UNK with the UNK of long life after all man s time on earth was simply to UNK and UNK for UNK in the world of god UNK on earth did not UNK with christian UNK UNK was not the only alchemist of the high middle ages but he was the most significant his works were used by UNK alchemists of the UNK through UNK centuries other alchemists of UNK s time UNK several UNK first and most UNK nearly all were members of the UNK this was simply because few people outside the UNK schools had the education to UNK the arabic UNK works also alchemy at this time was UNK by the church as a good method of UNK and UNK UNK alchemy was UNK to the UNK UNK of UNK because it UNK a UNK view of the universe when men were just UNK to learn about UNK so by the end of the UNK century alchemy had developed into a UNK UNK system of belief UNK believed in the UNK UNK theories of UNK that is to say they believed that UNK that UNK UNK and other UNK could have an effect on the human body e g if one could learn the UNK of UNK gold one could use the UNK to UNK the human soul they believed in the four elements and the four UNK as described above and they had a strong tradition of UNK their written ideas in a UNK of UNK UNK set with UNK to UNK the UNK finally the alchemists UNK their art they UNK UNK with UNK and made UNK and theories about how the universe UNK their UNK philosophy UNK around their belief that man s soul was divided within himself after the UNK of UNK by UNK the two parts of man s soul man could be UNK with god in the UNK century these views UNK a major change william of UNK an UNK UNK who UNK in one three four nine UNK the UNK view of UNK between UNK

the UNK century was named UNK UNK UNK this alchemist believed himself to be a UNK and actually thought himself capable of UNK UNK his influence was UNK but like UNK he produced writings which were
